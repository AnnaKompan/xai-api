# Ready-to-Use Curl Commands

This document provides copy-pastable curl commands for testing the API endpoints, with placeholders you need to replace.

## Configuration

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual xAI API key in all commands.

## Health Check

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Image Generation

### Basic Image Generation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/images/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A beautiful mountain landscape at sunset",
    "model": "grok-2-image"
  }'
```

### Multiple Images

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/images/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Abstract geometric patterns in bright colors",
    "model": "grok-2-image",
    "n": 3
  }'
```

### Base64 Response Format

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/images/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A serene ocean view with palm trees",
    "model": "grok-2-image",
    "response_format": "b64_json"
  }'
```

> **Note**: xAI API currently doesn't support the `quality`, `size`, and `style` parameters. These will be ignored if included in your request.

### OpenAI SDK Compatible Endpoint

For compatibility with the OpenAI SDK, you can also use the `/images/generations` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A cyberpunk city scene with flying cars",
    "model": "grok-2-image",
    "n": 1
  }'
```

This is functionally identical to the `/images/generate` endpoint but matches the OpenAI SDK endpoint naming.

## Image Vision

### Analyze Image from URL

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/vision/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-2-vision-latest",
    "image": {
      "url": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dogs-cats-brain-study.jpg"
    },
    "prompt": "What animals are in this image and what are they doing?",
    "detail": "high"
  }'
```

### Analyze Local Image (Base64)

First, encode your image:

```bash
base64 -i path/to/your/image.jpg | tr -d '\n' > image_base64.txt
```

Then use the encoded data:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/vision/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-2-vision-latest",
    "image": {
      "b64_json": "'$(cat image_base64.txt)'"
    },
    "prompt": "Describe this image in detail",
    "detail": "high"
  }'
```

## Chat Completions

### Simple Question

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-3-mini-beta",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What are the main challenges in artificial intelligence today?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### OpenAI SDK Vision Format

For compatibility with the OpenAI SDK's vision handling, you can send vision requests through the chat completions endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-2-vision-latest",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": [
          {
            "type": "image_url",
            "image_url": {
              "url": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dogs-cats-brain-study.jpg",
              "detail": "high"
            }
          },
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "What animals are in this image?"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "temperature": 0.01
  }'
```

This format is needed when using the OpenAI SDK for vision analysis.

### Conversation with System Prompt

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-3-mini-beta",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a creative writing assistant specialized in science fiction."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a short opening paragraph for a story about space exploration."
      }
    ],
    "temperature": 0.8
  }'
```

### Multi-turn Conversation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-3-mini-beta",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is deep learning?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\") to analyze various factors of data. It attempts to mimic the human brain, allowing it to learn from large amounts of data and make intelligent decisions."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "How is it different from traditional machine learning?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```
